In July 2018 the BBC Shared Data Unit [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-44871578) there were as few as 41 fans to each officer at one of the most-heavily-policed football matches in the UK in the 2017/18 season.

We compared Freedom of Information responses from 37 police forces covering football teams in the Premier League, English Football League, Scottish Championship and Scottish Premiership and attendance figures from the statistics company Opta.

Our analysis found:

- The number of officers sent to matches ranged from zero to a peak of 587 when Middlesbrough visited Sunderland - an officer for every 50 spectators
- The most-heavily-policed Premier League fixture was Tottenham Hotspur vs West Ham United at Wembley Stadium with 477 officers, one for every 105 spectators
- There was a wide variation across police force areas in how much of their costs they recouped
- The most expensive policing operation in England was Sheffield Wednesday against Sheffield United at Hillsborough, which cost £203,000. The home club was billed for £41,000.
- In Scotland, the most expensive policing operation was Rangers vs. Celtic at Ibrox at £64,000
